Bike Sales DashboardThis project showcases my expertise in Excel, including data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard creation. The dashboard provides insights into customer behaviour, income patterns, and commute distances, enabling non-technical stakeholders to make informed decisions.OverviewThe Bike Sales Dashboard is an Excel-based project that analyzes customer data and extracts actionable insights. I processed and transformed the data using raw data from GitHub to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard. This project demonstrates how Excel can be utilized to derive meaningful narratives from raw datasets.Goals	¥	Visualize customer demographics and purchasing patterns to understand key drivers for bike sales.	¥	Highlight the average income per purchase by gender and the distribution of customer commute distances.	¥	Showcase the power of Excel in cleaning raw data, generating pivot tables, and building interactive dashboards.	¥	Enable non-technical stakeholders to easily filter data by marital status, region, or education for customized insights.Insights	¥	Income Analysis: Males have a higher average income per purchase (£56,908) compared to females (£52,901).	¥	Age Brackets: Middle-aged customers are the most active bike buyers.	¥	Commute Distance: Most bike purchases occur among customers with commute distances of 0Ð1 miles.	¥	User Filters: Marital status, region, and education significantly influence purchasing trends, as seen through dynamic filtering.Tools Used	¥	Excel:	¥	Data cleaning and preparation.	¥	Pivot table creation for summarizing key metrics.	¥	Dashboard creation for data visualization.	¥	Data Cleaning Techniques:	¥	Removing duplicates.	¥	Aligning and standardizing raw data formats.Features	¥	Interactive Dashboard: Users can filter data dynamically using slicers for marital status, region, and education.	¥	Key Visuals:	¥	Average income per purchase by gender.	¥	Customer age brackets and their impact on purchases.	¥	Commute distance trends for bike buyers.	¥	Pivot Tables:	¥	Summarized key metrics for age, income, and commute distance.	¥	Customizable Filters:	¥	Allow stakeholders to explore data tailored to their focus areas.
